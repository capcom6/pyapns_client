## Features

- Uses the new Apple APNs HTTP/2 protocol with persistent connections
- Supports token-based authentication (no need to renew your certificates anymore) and certificate-based authentication
- Uses the httpx HTTP client library
- Supports the new iOS 10 features such as Collapse IDs, Subtitles, and Mutable Notifications
- Makes integration and error handling simple with auto-retry on APNs errors
- Supports asynchronous sending of notifications

## Prerequisites

Before using `pyapns_client3`, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- APNs SSL certificates (if using certificate-based authentication)
- An Apple Developer account with access to the Apple Push Notification service

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install pyapns_client3
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Usage

The library contains four main parts:

- Clients (sync and async)
- Authentificators (by token and certificate)
- Payloads
- Exceptions

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Client

The `APNSClient` and `AsyncAPNSClient` classes provide the main functionality for sending push notifications. The synchronous client allows you to send notifications in a blocking manner, while the asynchronous client enables you to send notifications in a non-blocking manner, suitable for asyncio-based applications. Both client classes can be used as context managers, allowing for automatic resource cleanup.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Authentificator

The library supports two types of authentication for sending push notifications. The `TokenBasedAuth` class allows you to authenticate using token-based authentication, eliminating the need to renew your APNS SSL certificates. The `CertificateBasedAuth` class enables certificate-based authentication, where you provide the path to your APNs SSL certificate and private key.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Payload

The library provides classes for creating different types of payloads for your push notifications. The `IOSPayload` class allows you to create a payload with various properties such as alert, badge, sound, and custom data. You can also use the `IOSPayloadAlert` class to create a payload alert with title, subtitle, and body.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Exceptions

The library defines several exceptions that can be raised during the push notification process. These exceptions include `UnregisteredException`, `APNSDeviceException`, `APNSServerException`, and `APNSProgrammingException`. You can catch these exceptions to handle different scenarios, such as unregistered devices, device-related errors, server-related errors, and programming errors.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Logging

`pyapns_client3` utilizes the standard `logging` package to provide built-in logging capabilities. The library includes an internal logger named `pyapns_client` that you can configure to track and debug the push notification process.

## Example

Here's an example of using the `AsyncAPNSClient` with token-based authentication to send push notifications asynchronously:

```python
# Import necessary classes and modules
from pyapns_client import AsyncAPNSClient, TokenBasedAuth, IOSPayload, IOSNotification

async def send_push_notifications():
    # Create an instance of the AsyncAPNSClient with the necessary parameters
    async with AsyncAPNSClient(
        mode=AsyncAPNSClient.MODE_DEV,
        authentificator=TokenBasedAuth(
            auth_key_path='/path/to/auth_key.p8',
            auth_key_id='AUTHKEY123',
            team_id='TEAMID1234'
        ),
        root_cert_path='/path/to/root_cert.pem',
    ) as client:
        try:
            # Create the payload for the notification
            payload = IOSPayload(alert='Hello from pyapns_client3!', sound='default')

            # Create the notification object with the payload and other optional parameters
            notification = IOSNotification(payload=payload, priority=10)

            # Send the notification asynchronously to one or more device tokens
            await client.push(notification=notification, device_token='DEVICE_TOKEN_HERE')
        except UnregisteredException as e:
            print(f'device is unregistered, compare timestamp {e.timestamp_datetime} and remove from db')
        except APNSDeviceException:
            print('flag the device as potentially invalid and remove from db after a few tries')
        except APNSServerException:
            print('try again later')
        except APNSProgrammingException:
            print('check your code and try again later')
        else:
            # Handle successful push
            print('Push notification sent successfully!')

# Run the async function to send push notifications
asyncio.run(send_push_notifications())
```
